    Set up the accusation feature. When the human presses the accusation button, they are prompted for an accusation. If the accusation is correct it displays a congraulations and ends the game. If it isn't, it ends the player's turn. This logic applies to the computers too except they accuse automatically if they find a suggestion that cant be disproved

    Set up the logic for the computer player's turns so they will prompt a suggestion if they enter a room and the GUI will update accordingly. persons who are suggested will be moved to the room the suggestion was made

    Made methods to generate the dialogs for making a suggestion and making an accusation. These have no functionality yet, we just have the ability to set them to visible. Still need to add the logic to make the player's suggestions/accusations behave as expected

    Finished player movement. When the game begins it will start on the human player. When a new location is selected the board redraws with the new player locations. When it is the computer's turn it automatically processes the turn by selecting a target and moving the computer to that target. Next Player button is functioning properly, only allowing the player to keep going if the player has finished their turn or if its a computer player's turn

    Did a lot of refactoring. Pretty much turned every array/set that just tracked strings and changed them to track cards, for the sake of consistency. Set up Solution class to contain public cards for person, room, and weapon. Changed every place that looks at the solution, suggestion, or accusation to use the Solution object instead of the list of strings we were using. Currently gameActionTests is working, but need to go back and fix all the other test files as well.

    testComputerSuggestion tests are now passing. created arrayLists for people, weapons, and rooms not yet seen by the player, which is initially populated when dealing cards.

    Created testComputerSuggestion J-Unit test that tests that when a computer makes a suggestion where they have multiple options for persons and weapons: a random person and weapon is chosen and the room is always the room the player is in. It also checks that when the computer player has only 1 unseen person/weapon left it will always pick that unseen option. Tests are currently failing with no implementation.

    Added a getTarget function to the computer player which checks if the computer has access to a doorway it did not just visit, and if so it returns that space as the new target. Otherwise it chooses a random new location as the target. This makes the tests made for gameActionTests (testComputerTargets) work

    Refactored calcAdjancenies. Fixed a bug in calcTargets where all instances of the 'visited' set where instead using the 'targets' set, thus making the function not work properly. Added a check in calcTargets that resets the visited and targets sets if it's the first time looping through the recursive function again (finding a new targets list). Added a check in calcTargets to add any cells it finds that are doorways to the targets list. All tests in Board Adj Target Tests is running correctly.

Added a check in loadRoomConfig() that throws a BadConfigFormatException when the config file contains a room type that isn't 'Card' or 'Other'. Added functionality to BadConfigFormatException so it writes errors to an ErrorLog.txt file with the error's date and message.
