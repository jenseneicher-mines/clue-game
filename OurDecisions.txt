Kai Mizuno and Jensen Eicher Decisions for JUnitTests

Changed NUM_ROWS and NUM_COLUMNS to match our board size
Changed setUp() to read in our config files

testRooms()
	We chose a random set of 6 rooms from our legend to test that they were correctly loaded
	Library, Den, Cloakroom, Gallery, Porch, Bathroom

FourDoorDirections() 
	We randomly chose 4 doors who all had different directions, Down, Up, Left, Right and tested that directions were read correctly
	we used Library, Kitchen, Tackroom, and Hall

testNumberOfDoorways()
	This method tests that we correctly identified all doors in the csv file (16)

testRoomInitials()
	This method gets the specified cell and makes sure its the one we expect (the rooms are in the correct place and have correct letters)
