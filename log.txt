    Addressed concerns brought up in code review and refactored

commit 335b2971df405e366aa34d622e9ecb5caf3bae5c
Author: Kai Mizuno <kmizuno@mymail.mine.edu>
Date:   Mon Oct 21 20:12:37 2019 -0600

    Refactored calcAdjancenies. Fixed a bug in calcTargets where all instances of the 'visited' set where instead using the 'targets' set, thus making the function not work properly. Added a check in calcTargets that resets the visited and targets sets if it's the first time looping through the recursive function again (finding a new targets list). Added a check in calcTargets to add any cells it finds that are doorways to the targets list. All tests in Board Adj Target Tests is running correctly.

    Added a check in loadBoardConfig() that throws a BadConfigFormatException if the board config contains a room that isn't in the legend. Added a check in loadRoomConfig() that throws a BadConfigFormatException when the config file contains a room type that isn't 'Card' or 'Other'. Added functionality to BadConfigFormatException so it writes errors to an ErrorLog.txt file with the error's date and message.
